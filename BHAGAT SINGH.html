   <h1>Bhagat Singh Biography</h1>
   <p> One of the most important revolutionaries in the Indian Nationalist Movement is Bhagat Singh. On September 28,
      1907, Kishan Singh and Vidyavati gave birth to Bhagat Singh in Banga, Lyallpur District (now Pakistan). When he
      was born, his uncles Ajit and Swaran Singh, as well as his father Kishan Singh, were all imprisoned for protesting
      the 1906 Colonization Bill. Being raised in a politically conscious household where his family supported the
      Ghadar Party, young Bhagat Singh developed a sense of patriotism.

      Bhagat Singh started supporting Mahatma Gandhi’s Non-Cooperation Movement at a very young age. Bhagat Singh openly
      resisted the British and carried out Gandhi’s request by setting fire to publications that were sponsored by the

      he also backed the Indian National Congress and the objectives of the Non-Cooperation Movement. After the Chauri
      Chaura Incident, Gandhi demanded that the movement against non-cooperation be abandoned. Bhagat Singh
      disassociated himself from Gandhi’s nonviolent effort because of the choice and joined the Young Revolutionary
      Movement instead. Thus began his career as the most well-known proponent of a bloody uprising against the British
      Raj.

      The Naujawan Bharat Sabha was established in March 1925, with Bhagat Singh serving as its secretary, and was
      motivated by nationalist movements in Europe. In addition, Bhagat Singh joined the radical Hindustan Republican
